# 交大主题LaTeX幻灯片模版 
# SJTU Slides LaTeX Templates

## Description
This is a latex template for the convenience of students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University to prepare for their presentation slides. SJTU color themes are added, with support from different layout themes. 

Although it comes with a default setting, it's thoroughly explained in the file how to further customize the template according to your own flavour. 

An example file of how the theme looks like is also attached. Please see below for an example of the title page.
